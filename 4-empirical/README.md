# Empirical Analysis: Model Comparison and Parameter Analysis

This directory contains the scripts used for *Part 2* of the thesis. More specifically, it contains the following files and subfolders: 

- **prepare_data.Rmd**: This file contains the code used to prepare the empirical data for fitting. Note that the data cannot be provided due to ethical concerns.
- **fitting/**: This contains all scripts to fit the empirical data on each of the models. The .R files contain the code to run the models, while the .sh files contain the commands to run the .R files from the command line in parallel and save output in .log files. The output is not provided, due to size limitations. The data is not provided for ethical reasons, and the output is not provided, due to size limitations.
- **model_comparison/**: This contains the scripts and outputs for model comparison.  
- **analysis/**: This contains the scripts and outputs for the analysis of parameters.
- **quality_checks/**: This contains the scripts and outputs for quality checks performed on all fitted models.  

Note that there are slight differences in the variable names in the code and those mentioned in the paper. For a mapping of values see the README file in the main directory.
